### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

cd reddit-sents
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download required NLTK data (this will happen automatically on first run, but you can also do it manually):

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')
